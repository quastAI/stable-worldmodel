"""Pluggable planning cost layer for stable world models.

Decouples the planning cost from the world model: a ``ShootingCostEvaluator`` composes
any model exposing the ``Dynamics`` surface (``encode``/``rollout``) with a
swappable ``Objective``, and duck-types as the ``Costable`` the solvers expect.
