"""Compose a world model with a pluggable objective into a ``Costable``.

``ShootingCostEvaluator`` is the *single-shooting* cost strategy: it rolls the
dynamics out over the full action sequence in one shot, then scores the
resulting trajectory. It splits the world model's monolithic ``get_cost`` into
its three concerns — goal **encode**, dynamics **rollout**, and the
**objective** — letting the objective be swapped freely. Because it exposes
``criterion`` and ``get_cost``, the unmodified solvers consume it exactly like
a world model. The ``Dynamics`` and ``Objective`` protocols it composes live in
:mod:`stable_worldmodel.protocols`.

    Subclasses ``torch.nn.Module`` and registers the world model as a submodule,
    so ``parameters()`` reaches the real model and solvers (CEM/GD) infer the
    candidate dtype from it instead of falling back to float32.

    The actor warm-start tail-fill — a solver calling ``model.get_action`` for
    ``Actionable`` models such as tdmpc2 — is forwarded to the wrapped model
    when that model is itself ``Actionable`` (e.g.
    :class:`~stable_worldmodel.wm.gcidm.GCIDM`, which carries a
    goal-conditioned policy head). For plain ``LeWM``-style models the
    attribute is absent, so a solver probing for it sees no actor and
    zero-pads as before.

    Args:
        model: World model providing ``encode``/``rollout`` (the ``Dynamics``
            surface). Registered as a submodule so ``parameters()`` reaches it.
        objective: The cost to apply to the rolled-out ``info_dict``.
        constraints: Optional ``Objective`` terms reused as constraints, each
            returning ``(B, S)`` under the ``LagrangianSolver`` convention
            that a term is satisfied when ``<= 0``. When given,
            ``get_constraints`` is exposed and stacks them into ``(B, S, C)``;
            otherwise the attribute is absent, so a solver probing for it sees
            no constraints.
        encode_goal: Optional ``fn(model, info_dict) -> goal_emb`` to override
            the default goal encoding. Set to ``None`` on the call to skip goal
            encoding entirely (e.g. when the caller pre-populates ``goal_emb``).
